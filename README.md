# AudioLink Speaker
## An audio reactive speaker prefab for unity, using AudioLink from [llealloo](https://github.com/llealloo/vrc-udon-audio-link/tree/master)
This asset needs [AudioLink](https://github.com/llealloo/vrc-udon-audio-link/releases) installed in you Unity project in order to work.

# Instalation
If installing for VRChat, I strongly reccomend using [VRChat Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/) to keep your project packages updated
1. Open your Unity project and make sure [AudioLink](https://github.com/llealloo/vrc-udon-audio-link/releases) is installed
2. (With your project focused) Doubble click the **Seiborg - AudioLink Reactive Speaker.unitypackage** and inport the package
3. A folder should be in the your **Assets** folder labeled **_seiborg**
4. There is a Demo Scene located in **Assets\_seiborg\Scene**
