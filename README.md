# Installation
This asset needs [AudioLink](https://github.com/llealloo/vrc-udon-audio-link/releases) installed in your Unity project to have full functionality.
If installing for VRChat, I strongly recommend using [VRChat Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/) to keep your project packages updated.

2. With your project focused, double click the "**Seiborg - AudioLink Reactive Speaker.unitypackage**" then click import.
3. A folder should appear in the your **Assets** folder labeled **_seiborg**
4. There is a Demo Scene located in ```Assets\_seiborg\Scene```
